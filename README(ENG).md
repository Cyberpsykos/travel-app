# **The Mobility Challenge Travel app**

## Introduction
This React app was created for a competition regarding sustainable and climate-smart mobility solutions, arranged by Consid & Riksbyggen during 2022  

*Created by: Josiah Barkström and David Fagerström*

## The goal
The idea and goal of the competition were to innovate a mobility solution making transportation and travel easier for the residents of Kv. Spårvagnshallarna in their everyday lives and guiding them to make a more thought out way of transportation in terms of the effect on climate, time, and money. It should be easy to travel climate-smart.

## Project idea
We had the idea to make a web-based mobile app that makes it easier and faster to compare multiple ways of transportation and lets the user pick their desired way of transportation based on climate effect, time and money. With this project, we wanted to encourage more people to go outside their comfort zone and try out new means of climate-smart transportation

## Why you should pick our solution

Our app has a target group and combines all local methods of transportation within Helsingborg in one idealistic package.

Our app is easily scalable and can be blown up and used in multiple regions in Sweden, supporting and integrating even more methods of transportation from multiple different companies/brands.

We work in our customer's interest in combining info from multiple different apps and presenting it in one complete package. Saving them time and the hassle of downloading and updating multiple apps 

With our app solution, we present the end-user with a bigger picture of how their day-to-day traveling habits affect the environment, their economy, and time. With our tool, we want to inspire people to look outside the box and try on new ways of travel they maybe did not think of before. 

## App functions
Listed here are the functions we are currently implementing and developing into the app.

- An easy to maneuver clean website with its own identity

- Choice of transportation:

    - Passenger car
    - Pool car
    - Bike
    - Pool Bike
    - Bus (Skånetrafiken)
    - Electric scooter (Bolt)
    - Walk
    
## Extra functions
Listed here are the ideas we would like to implement for a future version of the app and would be needed for it to be put out into a larger production state.

- Payment methods (Swish, Credit card, Prepayed card)
- More API's from more regions
- location data from the different traveling methods
- Support for trips abroad?

## Execution
We jumped on the development train a bit late and did not have much time to put everything into a finished app. We started our project by making a design document, writing down points we found important for a climate and mobility-focused app Furthermore, we continued the project by making a quick mockup of our vision and 

## Design decisions
We choose to use the React language which includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding. We made use of React because of its flexibility in programming for multiple platforms using multiple integrations, its support from Meta, The very comprehensive documentation, and its great developer experience.

For the API integration, we decided to go with TrafikLab for the required public transportation APIs needed for the project. We choose Trafiklab because of: the ease of use, its documentation, for future continued support and development, but also for its future scalability in implementing multiple public transport regions in future versions of the app.

For the electric scooters, we decided to start off the project by just integrating bolt's electric scooters by using Bolt API.

Lastly, to calculate the time of travel by a car walking, and scootering, we used Google Maps API. We choose to go with Google because of our experience with the Google app and our experience with their reliable maps application.
